- 👋 Hi, I’m @turtle
- 👀 I’m interested in it all.
- 🌱 I’m always learning, but more recently .Py Ps and large-scale project deployments, AI, CISSP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything :)
- 📫 How to reach me: Smoke signals east of the valley de Almas Perdidas after the great light passes the highest point in the mid-summer sky. Wednesdays preferred. Please, Send a Carrier pigeon from the town to the north and appraise me your intent before any reconnoitering to avoid recrudesce. Trespass at your own risk.    Or talk to Tim... He knows how to reach me.
